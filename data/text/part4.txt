Hi, everyone, let's begin the weekly call-center staff meeting. First of all, I wanted to let you know that I've just hired two additional customer service representatives to help out on the phones. Yes, I know that's not enough. But there isn't much I can do with our budget. Anyway, their first day is next Monday, but before they start, it's important that we revise our training manual. I'm going to assign a section to each one of you. Please go through your section, and if you see anything that has to be corrected, please send me an e-mail with the page number and your comments. I'll review all your suggestions and make a final draft.
