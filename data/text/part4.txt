We have quite a bit to cover at todayâ€™s meeting. Since our computer system was hacked last month, the cyber security team has designed new procedures. First we will have a brief overview of the changes. You will then receive new employee IDs for entering and exiting the building, and an explanation of how to use them. This section will take approximately forty-five minutes. Issuing new computer login passwords will take about ten minutes. As you leave the meeting, please sign a form affirming that you will not share your secure passwords and identification card. Since we only have an hour, please refrain from asking questions until the end of the meeting.
